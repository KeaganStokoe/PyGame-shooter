# PyGame-shooter
Shooter and collision based game built to learn pygame library. 

Using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) library, this game has the following features: 

- One player object that is moved using the arrow keys, or WASD keys. The player is able to shoot the enemy objects. 10 hits on the enemy and the player wins.
- 3 enemy objects. The enemies all move across the screen from different positions. If the player object collides with any
enemy object, they lose, and the game ends.
- 1 ‘prize’ object. If the player object collides with the prize object, they win, and the game ends.

To run this game, it is necessary to install pygame. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). 

> "I think DOOM had just the right mix of elements that keep people coming back to it: great monsters, excellent weapons with great balance, a spooky environment and extreme speed." - John Romero.

It's not DOOM, but it's fun.
